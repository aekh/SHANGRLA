#
# class CVR:
#     """
#     Generic class for cast-vote records.
#
#     The CVR class does not necessarily impose voting rules. For instance, the social choice
#     function might consider a CVR that contains two votes in a contest to be an overvote.
#
#     Rather, by default a CVR is supposed to reflect what the ballot shows, even if the ballot does not
#     contain a valid vote in one or more contests.
#
#     Class method get_vote_for returns the vote for a given candidate if the candidate is a
#     key in the CVR, or False if the candidate is not in the CVR.
#
#     This allows very flexible representation of votes, including ranked voting.
#
#     For instance, in a plurality contest with four candidates, a vote for Alice (and only Alice)
#     in a mayoral contest could be represented by any of the following:
#             {"id": "A-001-01", "pool": False, "pool_group": "ABC", "phantom:: False"votes": {"mayor": {"Alice": True}}}
#             {"id": "A-001-01", "votes": {"mayor": {"Alice": "marked"}}}
#             {"id": "A-001-01", "votes": {"mayor": {"Alice": 5}}}
#             {"id": "A-001-01", "votes": {"mayor": {"Alice": 1, "Bob": 0, "Candy": 0, "Dan": ""}}}
#             {"id": "A-001-01", "votes": {"mayor": {"Alice": True, "Bob": False}}}
#     A CVR that contains a vote for Alice for "mayor" and a vote for Bob for "DA" could be represented as
#             {"id": "A-001-01", "votes": {"mayor": {"Alice": True}, "DA": {"Bob": True}}}
#
#     NOTE: some methods distinguish between a CVR that contains a particular contest, but no valid
#     vote in that contest, and a CVR that does not contain that contest at all. Thus, the following
#     are not equivalent:
#             {"id": "A-001-01", "votes": {"mayor": {}} }
#             and
#             {"id": "A-001-01", "votes": {} }
#
#     Ranked votes also have simple representation, e.g., if the CVR is
#             {"id": "A-001-01", "votes": {"mayor": {"Alice": 1, "Bob": 2, "Candy": 3, "Dan": ''}}}
#     Then int(get_vote_for("Candy","mayor"))=3, Candy's rank in the "mayor" contest.
#
#     CVRs can be flagged as `phantoms` to account for ballot cards not listed in the manifest using the boolean
#     `phantom` attribute.
#
#     CVRs can be assigned to a `tally_pool`, useful for the ONEAudit method or batch-level comparison audits
#     using the `pool` attribute (batch-level comparison audits are not currently implemented)
#
#     CVRs can be flagged for use in ONEAudit "pool" assorter means. When a CVR is flagged this way, the
#     value of the assorter applied to the MVR is compared to the mean value of the assorter applied to the
#     CVRs in the tally pool the CVR belongs to.
#
#     CVRs can include sampling probabilities `p` and sample numbers `sample_num` (pseudo-random numbers
#     to facilitate consistent sampling)
#
#     CVRs can include a sequence number to facilitate ordering, sorting, and permuting
#
#     Methods:
#     --------
#
#     get_vote_for:
#          get_vote_for(candidate, contest_id) returns the value in the votes dict for the key `candidate`, or
#          False if the candidate did not get a vote or the contest_id is not in the CVR
#     has_contest: returns bool
#          does the CVR have the contest?

#                 2. Sample randomly from a set of such values
#             The rate of small values is `rate_1` if `rate_1 is not None`. If `rate is None`, for POLLING audits, gets
#             the rate of small values from the margin.
#             For Audit.AUDIT_TYPE.POLLING audits, the small values are 0 and the large values are `u`; the rest are 1/2.
#             For Audit.AUDIT_TYPE.CARD_COMPARISON audits, the small values are the overstatement assorter for an
#             overstatement of `u/2` and the large values are the overstatement assorter for an overstatement of 0.
#
#         This function is for a single assertion.
#
#         **Assumes that self.test.u has been set appropriately for the audit type (polling or comparison).**
#         **Thus, for comparison audits, the assorter margin should be be set before calling this function.**
#
#         Parameters
#         ----------
#         data: np.array
#             observations on which to base the calculation. If `data is not None`, uses them in a bootstrap
#             approach, rather than simulating errors.
#             If `self.contest.audit_type==Audit.POLLING`, the data should be (simulated or actual) values of
#             the raw assorter.
#             If `self.contest.audit_type==Audit.CARD_COMPARISON`, the data should be (simulated or actual)
#             values of the overstatement assorter.
#         prefix: bool
#             prefix the data, then sample or tile to produce the remaining values
#         rate_1: float
#             assumed rate of "small" values for simulations (1-vote overstatements). Ignored if `data is not None`
#             If `rate_1 is None and self.contest.audit_type==Audit.POLLING` the rate of small values is inferred
#             from the margin
#         rate_2: float
#             assumed rate of 0s for simulations (2-vote overstatements).
#         reps: int
#             if `reps is None`, builds the data systematically
#             if `reps is not None`, performs `reps` simulations to estimate the `quantile` quantile of sample size.
#         quantile: float
#             if `reps is not None`, quantile of the distribution of sample sizes to return
#             if `reps is None`, ignored
#         seed: int
#             if `reps is not None`, use `seed` as the seed in numpy.random to estimate the quantile
#
#         Returns
